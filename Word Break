139. Word Break

Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, 
determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple", "pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
             Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
             
Time: O(N^2)
Space: O(N) 
def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> bool:
        dp = [1]+[0]*len(s)
        a = set(wordDict)
        for i in range(1,len(s)+1):
            for j in range(0,i):
                if (dp [j] ==1 and (s[j:i] in a)):
                    dp[i] = True
        return dp[len(s)]
